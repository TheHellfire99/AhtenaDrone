    <div class="para_about"><p>Hey everyone! we are a bunch of high schools who have aimed to provide education for all! Our goal is to make sure all students around the world are able to get books no matter where they are. 
      Our initiative, Athena, is a light weight multipurpose drone that is used as a book delivery system. It can be deployed in 3rd world countries where the option of delivering books is not a choice. This can 
      reach any corner of the mordern world to deliver bundles of joy. This can also help students get books delivered on order. We all remeber the first day of school, our teachers gave us heavy books to carry home 
      and it killed our backs. This can help school drop off books at student's homes.</p>
